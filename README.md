### Technologies used:
1. Google Sheets: for data source.
2. Google App Script (in JavaScript): for analysing raw data to rank currencies strongest to weakest and sends results from Google Sheets to Google’s Firebase.
3. Firebase (stores data in json): database source for App authentication and data source.
4. React Native App (reads JavaScript): for developing an App compatible for iOS and Android.
5. Redux: for state management.

### Custom code (excluding libraries and dependencies):
1. ./src directory
2. ./GoogleAppScript.js
3. ./index.js

The Google App Script is included in the ./GoogleAppScript.js file.

### Personal Firebase Realtime database code has been removed for privacy from:
1. ./src/App.js = configuration code
2. ./GoogleAppScript.js = database secret

### Dependencies used:

Listed in the ./package.json file.
